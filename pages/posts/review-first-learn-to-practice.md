TLDR; This short lively book [First, Learn to Practice](https://www.amazon.co.uk/First-Learn-Practice-Tom-Heany/dp/1457507757) by [Tom Heany](http://www.tomheany.com/about-tom.html) provides a lot of sound ideas and advice for improving the effectiveness of your practice. I recommended it to anyone who wants some ideas to up their practice game.

During my school years I avoided music, drama and games so never experienced the joy of learning
skills through applied practice. For some reason I thought initial failure
meant I was not suited so I gave up. I did enjoy woodwork, metalwork and science subjects.

As a result, learning an instrument as an adult required me to figure out a lot of unfamiliar mental and physical stuff.
I just didn't realise it for a long time.
After many years of struggling to teach myself I finally found a tutor who did understand this (Jim Rintoul). As a result I've come much further in the last couple of years than from all my earlier efforts.

Recently, I stumbled across this book and decided to see if I could pick up a few
extra ideas for further improvement. I'm glad I did as it has both reinforced my understanding and inspired me.

The book provides:

"ideas, attitudes, approaches and techniques that will help you practice better, and as a result play better"

It is organised into three key topics:

- seven Big Ideas
- seven Good Habits, and
- three Tools.

One of the big ideas is that during practice we focus on _movement_. Once we
get that right the music can follow.

Tom points out that to understand we add new information to what we already know.
To perform skills, however, we repeat movements until they are correct and automatic.
That's something I failed to appreciate during my schooling.

Another big idea is that playing and practicing are quite distinct. Practice requires
noticing what happens when we play using a 'Mechanics mindset'. We then analyse
and learn what happens when we play. To practice we pick one specific thing and
then perform repetitions to improve that. If we work on the right things other
aspects will improve as well. Get small and go slow for maximum effect and the
hard parts will get sorted out. The final idea is to set your standards high while
practicing and aim for the best you can do.

The good habits are to be comfortable, be honest with yourself, be optimistic about
the results, be consistent, be persistent, go slow and make your practice musical.

Of the tools, having a solid plan and using a metronome are probable familiar to
most of us. The other Tool Looping may not be. This is not using a looper device,
though I find that can be an excellent learning tool. Rather it is the process
of iteration you use that pulls everything together to maximise your progress.
In short, you pick something small to work on and loop it while observing.
When you notice a problem you then drill down on that and loop more slowly at
a finer level of observation. Then you can build up again with te issue fixed.

That's a very brief summary of the many excellent ideas in this short lively book.
Do yourself a favour and take a little timeout to explore them and increase
your enjoyment. And enjoying practice is another of those BIG ideas.
