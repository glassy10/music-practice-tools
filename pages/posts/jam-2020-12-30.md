My first Jam at Jim's Garage.

Achieved my [Christmas Goal](/activities/goal-blues/).

Totally loved it - made loads of mistakes but kept going. The PJB Double Four was
plenty loud enough - only had it at half volume.

## Tunes

- Slow Blues in C - based on [Merry Go Round](/tunes/merry-go-round/) by Fleetwood Mac
- AB jam A: CD B: GCDF
- Reggae style
- Song for my Father

## Crew

- Drums - Gary
- Guitar - Kyle, James
- Bass - me
